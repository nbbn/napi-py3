# napi-py3

It's rewritten napi.py to Python 3. All subtitles are converted to utf-8 encoding.
7z required.

I've found on the Internet original script years ago.
It's almost impossible to point original source, feel free to google fragments of original file (the first commit) to find potential source.

## Usage

```sh
chmod +x napi.py
./napi.py filename_of_movie
```
